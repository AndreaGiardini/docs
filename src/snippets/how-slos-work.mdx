SLO alerting works on two principal ideas: **error budgets** and **burn rates**.

An **error budget** is a measure of the acceptable level of errors or service disruptions that a service can experience during a specified timeframe, without violating its agreed-upon reliability target. It can be represented as:

So for an SLO of 99% the error budget is:

$100\% - 99\% = 1\%$

The **burn rate** represents the pace at which the error budget is being consumed or "burned" by errors within a system or service. A burn rate of 1 or less indicates that the service is currently burning its error budget at a rate that aligns with the SLO targets. Conversely, a burn rate exceeding 1 indicates that the service is burning its error budget too quickly, which would result in a failed SLO if not addressed.

The burn rate makes up the basis of the SLO-based alert.

One final note before we dive in: SLOs are a blend of science and art. While this guide provides a solid starting point, it's important to customize the values to align with your specific business requirements and processes.

The best way to learn to use SLOs, like any engineering concept, is to go build with them.
