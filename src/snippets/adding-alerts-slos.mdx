# Adding alerts using Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) in {props.language}

Autometrics makes it easy to add Prometheus alerts using Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) to a function or group of functions.

This works using pre-defined Prometheus alerting rules, which can be loaded via the `rule_files` field in your Prometheus configuration. By default, most of the recording rules are dormant. They are enabled by specific metric labels that can be automatically attached by autometrics.
