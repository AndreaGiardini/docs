As of writing, build_info will not work correctly when using the default tracker
(`AUTOMETRICS_TRACKER=OPEN_TELEMETRY`). This will be fixed once the following PR
is merged on the opentelemetry-python project:
[open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python#3306](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-python/pull/3306)

autometrics-py will track support for `build_info` via #38
