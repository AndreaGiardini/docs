## Pre-requisites

1. Make sure you have set up and initialized Autometrics libraries as described in the [quickstart section](quickstart).

2. Add the pre-configured Prometheus rules file to your Prometheus configuration. This file is located in the [Autometrics shared repository](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/blob/main/autometrics.rules.yml)

## Usage

<Steps>

### Create `Objectives` with your desired SLOs

To use Autometrics SLOs and alerts, create one or multiple Objectives based on the function(s) success rate and/or latency, as shown below. 

```python
from autometrics import autometrics
from autometrics.objectives import Objective, ObjectiveLatency, ObjectivePercentile

API_SLO = Objective(
    "api_slo",
    success_rate=ObjectivePercentile.P99_9,
    latency=(ObjectiveLatency.Ms250, ObjectivePercentile.P99),
)
```

### Add `Objectives` to the `autometrics` decorator
The Objective (`API_SLO` in this case) can be passed as an argument to the
autometrics decorator to include the given function in that objective.

You can group multiple functions into a single objective by passing the same objective to multiple functions.

```python {10-20}
from autometrics import autometrics
from autometrics.objectives import Objective, ObjectiveLatency, ObjectivePercentile

API_SLO = Objective(
    "api_slo",
    success_rate=ObjectivePercentile.P99_9,
    latency=(ObjectiveLatency.Ms250, ObjectivePercentile.P99),
)

@autometrics(objective=API_SLO)
def create_user():
  # ...

@autometrics(objective=API_SLO)
def get_user():
  # ...

@autometrics(objective=API_SLO)
def delete_user():
  # ...
```



</Steps>

## Viewing SLOs and Alerts

Once you've added objectives to your code, you can use the [Autometrics Service-Level Objectives (SLO) Dashboards](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/tree/main/dashboards) to visualize the current status of your objective(s).
