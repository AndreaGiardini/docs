### Install the library

```bash
pip install autometrics
```


### Import the library and use the decorator

```python
from autometrics import autometrics

@autometrics
def sayHello:
   return "hello"

```

### Set the metrics collection library (optional)

Use the environment variable `AUTOMETRICS_TRACKER` to set the metrics collection
library. The default is `OPEN_TELEMETRY`.

Options:
- `OPEN_TELEMETRY` - uses `opentelemetry` to collect and expose metrics
- `PROMETHEUS` - uses `prometheus_client` to collect and expose metrics


### Install VSCode extension

Install the [Autometrics VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Fiberplane.autometrics) to get generated queries in your tooltips in your IDE.

### View your metrics in your IDE or dashboard

You can now navigate your code in your IDE, hover over the instrumented functions and you will see links for generated queries for your metrics.

If you have Grafana you can also import the [Autometrics dashboard](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared#dashboards) for an overview and detailed view of the function metrics.
