# Features

Autometrics leverages metaprogramming tools like macros, wrappers, and
decorators, along with existing metrics libraries to provide a seamless
experience for developers instrumenting their code.

### Graphs in your IDE

Easily explore your application's performance from within your editor.
Autometrics automatically inserts links to generated PromQL queries directly in
your function's doc comments.

started.](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Fiberplane.autometrics)

### Grafana dashboards for debugging

All metrics data Autometrics generates has standard names, enabling you to use
dashboards without any configuration. You can grab any of the already-created
dashboards, connect your Prometheus with Autometrics data, and start exploring.

Dashboards:
- [Autometrics Overview](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18505-autometrics-overview/)
- [Autometrics Function Explorer](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18504-autometrics-function-explorer/)
- [Autometrics Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18506-autometrics-service-level-objectives-slos/)

### Spot faulty commits and deploys

Autometrics can track your software versions and will writes queries that can help
pinpoint where and when issues were introduced.

Under the hood Autometrics produces a `build_info` metric and uses labels to
expose the version, commit and branch information of your app to Prometheus.

### Alerts and SLOs without YAML

Autometrics allows you to group instrumented functions in to Service-Level
Objectives (SLO) and create useful alerts on them all while keeping the context
in your application source code.

Alerts for any Autometrics SLO can be enabled using a *single* alerting rules
file:
[`autometrics.rules.yml`](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/blob/main/autometrics.rules.yml).
By default these rules are dormant, and are enabled only when metrics with
Autometrics SLO labels are registered.

The default set of rules will work for any project that uses the following objective
percentiles: 90%, 95%, 99%, 99.9%. If you want to use other percentiles you can
generate a new rules file, see [here for instructions](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-rs/tree/main/autometrics-cli)

### Open source and vendor agnostic

Autometrics can be incrementally adopted to work with most open-source metrics
libraries that you already use.
