# Features

Autometrics leverages metaprogramming tools like macros, wrappers, and
decorators, along with existing metrics libraries to provide a seamless
experience for developers instrumenting their code.

### Graphs in your IDE

Easily explore your application's performance from within your editor.

### Grafana dashboards for debugging

All metric data Autometrics generates has standard names, enabling you to use
functional dashboards.

### Spot faulty commits and deploys

Autometrics tracks your software versions and writes queries that can help
pinpoint where and when issues were introduced

### Alerts and SLOs without YAML

Autometrics allows you to group instrumented functions in to SLOs and create
useful alerts on them all while  keeping the context in your application source
code.

### Open source and vendor agnostic

Autometrics can be incrementally adopted with most open-source metrics libraries
that you already use.
