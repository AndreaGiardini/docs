## Pre-requisites

1. Make sure you have setup and initialized Autometrics libraries as described in [Quickstart section](quickstart).

2. Add the pre-configured Prometheus rules file to your Prometheus configuration. This file is located in the [Autometrics shared repository](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/blob/main/autometrics.rules.yml)

## Usage

<Steps>

### Create `Objectives` with your desired SLOs

To use autometrics SLOs and alerts, create one or multiple Objectives based on the function(s) success rate and/or latency, as shown below. 

```rust
use autometrics::objectives::{Objective, ObjectiveLatency, ObjectivePercentile};

const API_SLO: Objective = Objective::new("api")
    .success_rate(ObjectivePercentile::P99_9)
    .latency(ObjectiveLatency::Ms250, ObjectivePercentile::P99);

```

### Add `Objectives` to the `autometrics` macro
The Objective (`API_SLO` in this case) can be passed as an argument to the autometrics macro to include the given function in that objective.

```rust
#[autometrics(objective = API_SLO)]
pub fn create_user() {
        // ...
}
```

You can group multiple functions into a single objective by passing the same objective to multiple functions:

```rust
#[autometrics(objective = API_SLO)]
pub fn create_user() {
        // ...
}

#[autometrics(objective = API_SLO)]
pub fn get_user() {
        // ...
}

#[autometrics(objective = API_SLO)]
pub fn delete_user() {
        // ...
}
```

</Steps>

## Viewing SLOs and Alerts

Once you've added objectives to your code, you can use the [Autometrics Service-Level Objectives (SLO) Dashboards](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/tree/main/dashboards) to visualize the current status of your objective(s).
