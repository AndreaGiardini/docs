# What is Autometrics?

Autometrics is an observability micro-framework built for developers. It makes it easy to instrument any function with the most useful metrics: request rate, error rate, and latency. Autometrics uses instrumented function names to generate Prometheus queries so you don't need to hand-write complicated PromQL.

To make it easy for you to spot and debug issues in production, Autometrics inserts links to live charts directly into each function's doc comments and provides dashboards that work out of the box. It also enables you to create powerful alerts based on Service-Level Objectives (SLOs) directly in your source code. Lastly, Autometrics writes queries that correlate your software's version info with anomalies in the metrics to help you quickly identify commits that introduced bugs or latency.

Autometrics is built on the excellent Prometheus and OpenTelemetry open source projects.
