# Local development

Autometrics CLI enables a proper local workflow for developer metrics. You can add, test, and see the immediate effect of adding metrics to your functions in the Explorer UI. Your changes now won't require a full cycle of *change-commit-deploy-to-dev* to see if it reflects as you intended in your monitoring dashboard.

### Why locally?

- **Iterate faster**. Add, change, and validate metrics locally without having to commit and deploy to dev.
- **Collaborate easier**. Anyone on the team can experiment and share learnings from metrics without lengthy setup.

## How it works

When you run `am start <METRICS_ENDPOINTS>` in your terminal, the CLI will check if you have an available Prometheus binary on your computer. If not, it will download the latest version of Prometheus and start it on the port you specified. 

It will also start a web server with the Autometrics Explorer in which you can explore your instrumented functions and see the metrics they generate.

## Getting started with `am`

<Steps>

### Install the CLI

You can install the CLI using Homebrew or by downloading the binary directly.

<Tabs items={['macOS', 'Linux']}>
    <Tab>
        ```shell filename="$ shell"
        brew install autometrics-dev/am
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```shell filename="$ shell"
        curl ...
        ```
    </Tab>

</Tabs>


### Start Prometheus and Explorer UI

You can then start the Prometheus server and Explorer by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell filename="$ shell"
am start <METRICS_ENDPOINTS>
```
`<METRICS_ENDPOINTS>` - one or more port number + URL path combinations that expose metrics in the Prometheus format. The format you express your endpoint is quite flexible so any of the following will work:

| `METRICS_ENDPOINT` | Resolved URL |
| -------- | --- |
| `am start :3000` | http://localhost:3000/metrics |
| `am start 127.0.0.1` | http://127.0.0.1:80/metrics |
| `am start https://127.0.0.1` | https://127.0.0.1:443/metrics |
| `am start localhost:3030` | http://localhost:3030/metrics |
| `am start localhost:3030/api/metrics` | http://localhost:3030/api/metrics |
| `am start localhost:3030/api/observability` | http://localhost:3030/api/observability |




### Go to the Explorer

You can now navigate to http://localhost:6789 to see the Explorer. You can also see the Prometheus at http://localhost:9090.
