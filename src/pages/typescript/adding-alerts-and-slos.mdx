## Pre-requisites

1. Make sure you have setup and initialized Autometrics libraries as described in [Quickstart section](quickstart).

2. Add the pre-configured Prometheus rules file to your Prometheus configuration. This file is located in the [Autometrics shared repository](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/blob/main/autometrics.rules.yml)

## Usage

<Steps>

### Create `Objectives` with your desired SLOs

To use autometrics SLOs and alerts, create one or multiple Objectives based on the function(s) success rate and/or latency, as shown below. 

```ts
import { autometrics, Objective, ObjectiveLatency, ObjectivePercentile } from "autometrics";

const API_SLO: Objective = {
  name: 'api',
  successRate: ObjectivePercentile.P99_9,
  latency: [ObjectiveLatency.Ms250, ObjectivePercentile.P99],
};
```

### Add `Objectives` to the `autometrics` wrapper or decorator as an options object
The Objective (`API_SLO` in this case) can be added to the options object, passed into the autometrics wrapper including the given function in that objective.

Note: the options object, must always be the first item in the wrapper

```ts {9-11}
import { autometrics, Objective, ObjectiveLatency, ObjectivePercentile } from "@autometrics/autometrics";

const API_SLO: Objective = {
  name: 'api',
  successRate: ObjectivePercentile.P99_9,
  latency: [ObjectiveLatency.Ms250, ObjectivePercentile.P99],
};

const apiHandlerFn = autometrics({ objective: API_SLO }, function apiHandler(
  // ...
));
```

</Steps>

## Viewing SLOs and Alerts

Once you've added objectives to your code, you can use the [Autometrics Service-Level Objectives (SLO) Dashboards](https://github.com/autometrics-dev/autometrics-shared/tree/main/dashboards) to visualize the current status of your objective(s).
