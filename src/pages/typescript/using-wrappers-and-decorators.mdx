# Using wrappers and decorators in

## Node.js

Use Autometrics wrappers to instrument the functions you want to track (e.g.:
request handlers or database calls).

### Wrapping plain-old functions

Wrappers are simple functions that wrap the original function declaration and
instrument it with metrics. They allow the language service plugin to add
additional information in the type docs.

Use function wrappers to wrap request handlers, database calls, or other
pieces of important business logic that you want to measure.

> **Note**: Wrapped functions must be named. Autometrics will throw an error if
> it can't access the name of the function.

Example:

```typescript
import { autometrics } from "autometrics";

const createUserWithMetrics = autometrics(async function createUser(payload: User) {
  // ...
});

createUserWithMetrics();
```

### Decorating class methods

When using a decorator for a class method, it is wrapped in additional code that
instruments the method with OpenTelemetry metrics.

Here's a snippet from a NestJS example project that uses Autometrics:

```typescript
import { Controller, Get } from "@nestjs/common";
import { AppService } from "./app.service";
import { Autometrics } from "autometrics";

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(private readonly appService: AppService) {}

  @Get()
  @Autometrics()
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.getHello();
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can apply the same decorator to the entire class and
instrument all of its methods:

```typescript
// ...
@Autometrics()
export class AppController {
  // ...
  @Get()
  getHello(): string {
    return this.appService.getHello();
  }
}
```

## Browser (Experimental)

> **Note**
> Support for client-side use of the Autometrics library is still very early and
> experimental.

### Set up the push gateway

In order for Prometheus to succesfully get your client-side app metrics, you
will need to push them to an aggregating push gateway [like this
one](https://github.com/zapier/prom-aggregation-gateway).

Use the `init` function to configure the gateway URL that Autometrics should
push the data to. You can also set the push interval with the `pushInterval`
property (default is every 5000 miliseconds);

```typescript
init({ pushGateway: "<link_to_gateway>" });
```

### Use Autometrics wrapper with options

The same wrapper functions can be used in browser environments. Note that
bundlers often change the names of functions and modules in production, which
can impact the library.

To get around this issue, wrappers accept an options object as
their first argument, which explicitly assigns a function and module name.

```typescript
const myFunction = autometrics(
  {
    functionName: "myFunction",
    moduleName: "Module",
  },
  async () => {
    // ... myFunction body
  }
);
```
